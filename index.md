## About Me

Hi! I am a final year MPhil student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk). I am fortunate to be advised by [James Cheng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~jcheng/) and [Ming-Chang Yang](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~mcyang/). 

Before CUHK, I was an undergraduate at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](http://english.hust.edu.cn/), fortunately advised by [Wei Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~gswwang/) and [Pan Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cTpFPJgAAAAJ&hl=en).
